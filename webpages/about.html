  <h1 class="py-6">About Me</h1>
  <p>I’m Jermaine, an IT Technician with over 6 years of hands-on experience, <br /> 
  now on an exciting journey to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. Originally<br />  
  from the island of Dominica, I migrated to the USA with a deep curiosity for <br /> 
  technology that started early—at just 10 years old,learning to type on a typewriter. <br /> 
  That spark grew into a lifelong passion for problem-solving, taking things apart, <br /> 
  putting them back together, and unknowingly absorbing the foundations of IT long<br />  
  before I earned my certifications.</p>

  <p>In my IT career, I’ve mastered troubleshooting, system optimization, and client <br /> 
  support, but web development offers something new—an opportunity to build, create, <br /> 
  and bring ideas to life on the digital canvas. For me, coding is more than a career <br /> 
  path: it’s fun, challenging, and endlessly rewarding. I thrive on learning and pushing <br /> 
  boundaries, and I’m committed to crafting powerful, user-friendly web experiences.</p>

  <p>This portfolio is not just a showcase of my work, but a reflection of my journey—from <br /> 
  a curious kid in Dominica to an IT professional in the USA, now embracing the future as a <br /> 
  Full-Stack Web Developer.</p>
